## Presentation 

Hi, I'm Pierre-Etienne, pharmacist and data addict! Certified Data Scientist thanks to the Datacamp training courses, learning is more than a passion: it's a vital need! 
I learned a lot thanks to the community, so I want to share what I did and how I did it, hoping that one of my scripts will help someone one day and solve a problem.
