## Presentation 

Hi, I'm Pierre-Etienne, pharmacist and data addict! Certified Data Scientist thanks to the Datacamp training courses, learning is more than a passion: it's a vital need! 
I learned a lot thanks to the community, so I want to share what I did and how I did it, hoping that one of my scripts will help someone one day and solve a problem.

### 1. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing (Done)

Short name: Semmelweiss

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Data visualization, Probability & statistics, Importing & cleaning data, Case studies

<u>Principal packages</u>: Tidyverse, Patchwork

In the mid 1800s, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was an obstetrician at Vienna General Hospital. At the time, maternal death due to puerperal fever was common, but he was particularly concerned that the death rate in his clinic (Clinic 1) was much higher than the death rate in another clinic at Vienna General Hospital (Clinic 2). So what was the difference between these two clinics? Doctors and midwives worked in Clinic 1, while only midwives worked in Clinic 2. This led Dr. Semmelweis to hypothesize that doctors carried deadly "cadaverous particles" from their autopsies to their patients in Clinic 2.

In 1847, Dr. Semmelweis instated a policy where doctors had to use a chlorine solution to wash their hands between performing autopsies and seeing patients. The maternal mortality rate drastically decreased as seen in the plot below. Sadly, germ theory (the idea that there are particles that cause disease) was not widely accepted at the time, so his hypothesis was rejected by most doctors.

### 2. Rise and Fall of programming languages (Done)

Short name: Programming_languages

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Data visualization, Importing & cleaning data

<u>Principal packages:</u>: tidyverse, skimr.

It’s important to stay informed about trends in programming languages and technologies. Knowing what languages are growing or shrinking can help you decide where to invest. An excellent source to gain a better understanding of popular technologies is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack overflow is an online question-and-answer site for coding topics. By looking at the number of questions about each technology, you can get an idea of how many people are using it.

### 3. Iris dataset exploration

Short name : iris

<u>Tags</u>: Data visualization, Supervised machine learning, Unsupervised machine learning 

<u>Principal packages</u>: tidyverse, patchwork, corrplot, FactoMineR, factoextra, tidymodels, randomForest, ranger, plotly, gtsummary

The Iris dataset, also known as Fisher's Iris or Anderson's Iris, is a multivariate dataset introduced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of the application of linear discriminant analysis. Data were collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify variations in the morphology of iris flowers of three species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula. "All are from the same field, picked on the same day and measured on the same day by the same person with the same measuring tools".
