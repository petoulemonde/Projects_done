## Presentation 

Hi, I'm Pierre-Etienne, pharmacist and data addict! Certified Data Scientist thanks to the Datacamp training courses, learning is more than a passion: it's a vital need! 
I learned a lot thanks to the community, so I want to share what I did and how I did it, hoping that one of my scripts will help someone one day and solve a problem.

## Projects
### 1. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

Short name: Semmelweiss

<u>Language</u>: R

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Data visualization, Probability & statistics, Importing & cleaning data, Case studies

<u>Principal packages</u>: Tidyverse, Patchwork

In the mid 1800s, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was an obstetrician at Vienna General Hospital. At the time, maternal death due to puerperal fever was common, but he was particularly concerned that the death rate in his clinic (Clinic 1) was much higher than the death rate in another clinic at Vienna General Hospital (Clinic 2). So what was the difference between these two clinics? Doctors and midwives worked in Clinic 1, while only midwives worked in Clinic 2. This led Dr. Semmelweis to hypothesize that doctors carried deadly "cadaverous particles" from their autopsies to their patients in Clinic 2.

In 1847, Dr. Semmelweis instated a policy where doctors had to use a chlorine solution to wash their hands between performing autopsies and seeing patients. The maternal mortality rate drastically decreased as seen in the plot below. Sadly, germ theory (the idea that there are particles that cause disease) was not widely accepted at the time, so his hypothesis was rejected by most doctors.

### 2. Rise and Fall of programming languages

Short name: Programming_languages

<u>Language</u>: R

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Data visualization, Importing & cleaning data

<u>Principal packages:</u>: tidyverse, skimr.

It’s important to stay informed about trends in programming languages and technologies. Knowing what languages are growing or shrinking can help you decide where to invest. An excellent source to gain a better understanding of popular technologies is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack overflow is an online question-and-answer site for coding topics. By looking at the number of questions about each technology, you can get an idea of how many people are using it.

### 3. Iris dataset exploration

Short name: iris

<u>Language</u>: R

<u>Tags</u>: Data visualization, Supervised machine learning, Unsupervised machine learning 

<u>Principal packages</u>: tidyverse, skimr, patchwork, corrplot, FactoMineR, factoextra, tidymodels, randomForest, ranger, plotly, gtsummary

The Iris dataset, also known as Fisher's Iris or Anderson's Iris, is a multivariate dataset introduced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of the application of linear discriminant analysis. Data were collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify variations in the morphology of iris flowers of three species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula. "All are from the same field, picked on the same day and measured on the same day by the same person with the same measuring tools".

### 4. Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy

Short name: Life_expectancy_inequalities

<u>Language</u>: R

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Data visualization, Importing & cleaning data 

<u>Principal packages</u>: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2

Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth.

Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.

Let's create some plots to explore the inequalities about life expectancy at birth around the world. We will use a dataset from the United Nations Statistics Division.

### 5. SMS spam detection

Short name: SMS_spam

<u>Language</u>: Python

<u>Tags</u>: Data manipulation, Natural language processing, Supervised machine learning, deep learning

<u>Principal packages</u>: Pandas, Numpy, Keras

Spam is unsolicited and unwanted messages sent electronically and whose content may be malicious. Email spam is sent/received over the Internet while SMS spam is typically transmitted over a mobile network. We’ll refer to user that sent spam as ‘spammers’. SMS messages are usually very cheap (if not free) for the user to send, making it appealing for unrightful exploitation. This is further aggravated by the fact that SMS is usually regarded by the user as a safer, more trustworthy form of communication than other sources, e. g., emails.

The dangers of spam messages for the users are many: undesired advertisement, exposure of private information, becoming a victim of a fraud or financial scheme, being lured into malware and phishing websites, involuntary exposition to inappropriate content, etc. For the network operator, spam messages result in an increased cost in operations.

In the case under study, spam is an annoyance to the user and thus detrimental to the quality of the service that hurts the brand in the process. This can lead to complaints, low ratings and even loss of users, not to mention users getting scammed.
